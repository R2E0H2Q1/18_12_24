Here is a table of scores for the year 2022-2024 in various subjects for college students:

Run the queries to retrieve the table and records. Write queries that answer the following questions:

1. What is the average college score for each year? (Hint: year_exam by group?)

- SQL statement:
SELECT EXAM_YEAR as Year, round(avg(grade),2) as Average_Year
FROM grades
GROUP BY EXAM_YEAR;

-----> Answer: 
YEAR	AVERAGE_YEAR
2022	   82.92
2023	   86.4
2024	   87.5


2. What is the average score for each student separately, for the year 2024?

- SQL statement:
SELECT STUDENT_NAME as Student, round(avg(grade),2) as Average_Stu
FROM grades
WHERE EXAM_YEAR = 2024
GROUP BY STUDENT_NAME;

-----> Answer: 
  Student		Average_Stu
Arya Stark		   91.0
Bran Stark		   88.0
Cersei Lannister	   82.0
Daenerys Targaryen	   92.0
Jaime Lannister	           86.0
Jon Snow		   88.0
Samwell Tarly		   91.0
Sandor Clegane		   78.0
Tyrion Lannister	   94.0


3. Show, for each year, what was the highest score in each subject? What was the lowest?

- SQL statement:
SELECT EXAM_YEAR, SUBJECT_NAME, max(GRADE) AS MAX_SCORE, min(GRADE) AS MIN_SCORE
FROM grades
GROUP BY EXAM_YEAR, SUBJECT_NAME

-----> Answer: 
EXAM_YEAR	SUBJECT_NAME	MAX_SCORE     MIN_SCORE
  2022		  Biology	   89		 79
  2022		  Chemistry	   85		 76
  2022		  History	   83	         83
  2022		  Mathematics	   87		 78
  2022		  Physics	   91		 82
  2023		  Biology	   88		 78
  2023		  Chemistry	   93		 81
  2023		  History	   95		 77
  2023		  Mathematics	   95		 85
  2023	 	  Physics	   93		 76
  2024		  Biology	   90		 90
  2024		  Chemistry	   94		 86
  2024		  History	   90		 77
  2024	 	  Mathematics	   92		 88
  2024		  Physics	   92		 79


4. For each year, how many exams were taken for each subject?

- SQL Statement: 
SELECT EXAM_YEAR, SUBJECT_NAME, COUNT(GRADE) AS AMOUNT_TESTS
FROM grades
GROUP BY EXAM_YEAR, SUBJECT_NAME


-----> Answer: 
EXAM_YEAR	SUBJECT_NAME	AMOUNT_TESTS	
2022		Biology			3
2022		Chemistry		3
2022		History			1
2022		Mathematics		3
2022		Physics			3
2023		Biology			3
2023		Chemistry		2
2023		History			4
2023		Mathematics		3

2024		Biology			1
2024		Chemistry		3
2024		History			3
2024		Mathematics		2
2024		Physics			3


5. What were the subjects where the average score was above 85 (over all the years, not separately for each year)?

- SQL Statement: 
SELECT SUBJECT_NAME, avg(GRADE) AS AvERAGE_SUBJECT
FROM grades
GROUP BY SUBJECT_NAME
HAVING AVG(GRADE) > 85;   <---> HAVING clause enables you to specify conditions that filter which group results appear in the final results.


-----> Answer: 

SUBJECT_NAME	AVERAGE_SUBJECT
Mathematics	      87.25
Physics		      86.56


6. How many occurrences were there for each score above 90?

- SQL Statement: 
SELECT SUBJECT_NAME, count(GRADE) AS BIGGER_90
FROM grades
WHERE GRADE > 90
GROUP BY SUBJECT_NAME;

-----> Answer: 

SUBJECT_NAME	BIGGER_90
 Chemistry	    2
 History	    2
 Mathematics	    2
 Physics	    5
